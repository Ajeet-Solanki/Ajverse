        <h1>The Case of the Cold Shower</h1>
        <p>
            The image above shows a pristine, modern bathroom with a standard electric water heater. A homeowner has just installed a high-efficiency, multi-function power shower head—the kind that promises a deluge of water from multiple jets. They are thrilled.<br>
            However, after the very first shower, they have a complaint: "The shower starts perfectly hot, but after just 60 seconds, it goes completely ice cold! I have to wait 20 minutes for it to heat up again, and then it only lasts 60 seconds. My old shower head never did this. The heater is broken!"<br>
            A junior plumbing apprentice visits and suggests replacing the heating element. As an experienced engineer, you look at the system and know the heating element is likely fine. You know exactly what’s wrong.<br>
            <b>The Question: What is the specific mechanical diagnosis for this symptom, and why did changing the shower head trigger it?</b>
        </p>

            <h2>Hint 1</h2>
            <p>
                Thermodynamic Mixing: All water heaters must manage stratification. Hot water naturally rises to the top, and cold water enters at the bottom. The "hot" outlet must pull from the absolute top. How does the heater ensure this stratification is maintained during high flow?

            <h2>Hint 2</h2>
            <p>
                The New Variable: Think about the one thing that changed. The new power shower head has a much higher flow rate (liters per minute) than the old one. If the heater's capacity (say, 50 liters) hasn't changed, but the tank is emptying much faster, what dynamic is now dominant?

            <h2>Hint 3</h2>
            <p>
                The "Dip Tube" Clue: If you were to look at a cross-section of the heater, the incoming cold water pipe doesn't just empty at the bottom. It often uses a long internal pipe, called a "dip tube," to deliver the cold water directly to the base of the tank.
