        <h1>The Case of the Cold Shower</h1>

        <img src="../contents/Shower_Problem.png" alt="Electric Water Heater System Diagram" class="puzzle-image">

        <p>
            The image above shows a pristine, modern bathroom with a standard electric water heater. A homeowner has just installed a high-efficiency, multi-function power shower head. They are thrilled.<br><br>
            However, after the very first shower, they have a complaint: "The shower starts perfectly hot, but after just 60 seconds, it goes completely ice cold! My heater is broken!"<br><br>
            <b>The Question: What is the specific mechanical diagnosis for this symptom, and why did changing the shower head trigger it?</b>
        </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hint 1: Thermodynamic Mixing</h2>
            <p>All water heaters must manage stratification. Hot water naturally rises to the top, and cold water enters at the bottom. The "hot" outlet must pull from the absolute top. How does the heater ensure this stratification is maintained during high flow?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hint 2: The New Variable</h2>
            <p>Think about the one thing that changed. The new power shower head has a much higher flow rate (liters per minute) than the old one. If the heater's capacity (say, 50 liters) hasn't changed, but the tank is emptying much faster, what dynamic is now dominant?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hint 3: The "Dip Tube" Clue</h2>
            <p>If you were to look at a cross-section of the heater, the incoming cold water pipe doesn't just empty at the bottom. It often uses a long internal pipe, called a "dip tube," to deliver the cold water directly to the base of the tank.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="solution-btn" onclick="revealSolution()">The Solution (Think before you clicking!)</button>

        <div id="solution-content">
            <h2>The Diagnosis: A Broken Dip Tube (and Thermal Turbulence).</h2>
            <p>
               The issue is not that the water heater isn't heating. It is. It heats the 50 liters to the correct temperature. But when the homeowner turns on the new high-flow shower, a huge volume of cold water rushes into the inlet at the bottom.<br>
               In many heaters, a vertical "dip tube" guides this cold inflow to the very bottom, preventing it from mixing with the already-hot water at the top. If that dip tube is cracked, broken, or missing, the cold incoming water (which is entering much faster with the new shower head) shoots straight across the middle of the tank, causing massive turbulence. This turbulent mixing destroys the hot/cold stratification instantly. The cold water immediately pollutes the hot water at the top, and the outlet temperature drops to ambient in seconds. The old shower head had a low flow rate, which didn't create enough turbulence to expose the faulty dip tube.
